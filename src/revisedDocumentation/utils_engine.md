# Model Training and Evaluation Engine

## Overview
This file provides the main routines for training and evaluating PyTorch-based neural networks. It supports standard, graph-based, and multimodal models, centralizing the workflow for all project components.

## Standard Training Functions
- `train_step`: Executes a single epoch of training.
- `test`: Evaluates model performance on a test set.

## Graph Neural Network Functions
- `train_step_graph`, `test_graph`: Tailored for graph-based models, utilizing node features and edge indices.

## Multimodal Functions
- `train_step_multimodal`, `test_multimodal`: Handles separate inputs and outputs for multiple data types.
- `train_step_multimodal_health`, `test_multimodal_health`: Adds specialized processing for health-related datasets.

## Main Training Orchestration
- `train`: Central function to manage training loops, evaluation, and metric tracking. Supports early stopping and learning rate adjustments.

## Usage
Used in all model training notebooks, this module provides consistent and flexible functions for handling diverse data modalities and architectures.
