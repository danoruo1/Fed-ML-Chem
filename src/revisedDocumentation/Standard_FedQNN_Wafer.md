# Standard Federated Quantum Neural Network for Wafer Dataset

## Overview
This study employs federated learning with quantum-enhanced models for semiconductor wafer classification. Classical convolutional layers are augmented with a quantum layer and trained across distributed clients.

## Model Architecture
- CNN feature extractor with two convolutional layers and ReLU activations
- A classifier with one hidden layer
- A quantum circuit with 9 qubits and 9 layers using AngleEmbedding and BasicEntanglerLayers
- Outputs via PauliZ measurements

## Dataset
Wafer images resized to 64Ã—64 pixels are distributed across ten clients. Data augmentation is used to enhance robustness.

## Training Approach
The model is trained over 20 rounds of federated learning with 10 local epochs per round. Learning rates vary across clients. Adam optimizer and CrossEntropyLoss are applied.
